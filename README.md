Claude Code's `/buddy` assigns you a pet based on `hash(yourID + SALT)`. The result is permanent — same ID always gives the same pet.

**This tool changes your fate.** It finds a new SALT that makes your account ID produce the pet you want, then patches it into the Claude binary. One command. Permanent (until Claude updates).

## How it works

```
yourAccountUUID + SALT("friend-2026-401")
        │
        ▼
   Bun.hash() → Mulberry32 PRNG → rarity → species → shiny → ...
```

You can't change your UUID (server-assigned). But the SALT is a 15-character string hardcoded in the binary. Change it, and the same UUID produces a completely different pet.

## Quick Start (for everyone)

**You don't need to know how to code.** Just open Terminal and paste one line.

### Step 1: Open Terminal

On Mac: press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, hit Enter.

### Step 2: Paste this entire line and hit Enter

```
git clone https://github.com/kizhu/The-C-in-Claude-stands-for-Capybara.git && cd The-C-in-Claude-stands-for-Capybara && chmod +x patch.sh && ./patch.sh
```

### Step 3: Type the pet you want

You'll see a list of 18 pets. Type the name (e.g. `capybara`) and hit Enter. The script handles everything else automatically.

### Step 4: Restart Claude

Press `Cmd + Q` to fully quit Claude. Reopen it. Type `/buddy`. Done. ✨

> **Already ran it before and want to change again?** Open Terminal, paste:
> ```
> cd The-C-in-Claude-stands-for-Capybara && git pull && ./patch.sh
> ```

## Usage

```bash
# Want a legendary shiny dragon?
./patch.sh --species dragon --rarity legendary --shiny

# Just want a specific species
./patch.sh --species cat

# Already have a SALT from a friend?
./patch.sh --salt "aBcDeFgHiJkLmNo"

# Check what your current UUID produces
bun find-salt.js --uuid "your-uuid" --check
```

### Options

```
./patch.sh [options]

  --species <name>    Target species
  --rarity <name>     Minimum rarity (common/uncommon/rare/epic/legendary)
  --shiny             Require shiny variant
  --eye <char>        Target eye (· ✦ × ◉ @ °)
  --hat <name>        Target hat (none/crown/tophat/propeller/halo/wizard/beanie/tinyduck)
  --salt <str>        Use a pre-computed 15-char SALT directly
  --uuid <id>         Override UUID auto-detection
```

## FAQ

**Will this break my Claude?**
No. It changes one 15-char string in the binary. A backup is created automatically. Worst case: restore the backup.

**Will it survive Claude updates?**
No. Updates replace the binary. Re-run `./patch.sh` with the same options — takes seconds. Tip: set `"autoUpdates": false` in `~/.claude.json`.

**Why does it need Bun?**
Native Claude uses `Bun.hash()` internally. To find the right SALT, we need the exact same hash function. The script auto-installs Bun if missing.

**Does it work on Linux/Windows?**
`find-salt.js` is cross-platform. `patch.sh` currently supports macOS only (needs `codesign`). PRs welcome for other platforms.

**Can I share my SALT with friends?**
No — each SALT is computed for YOUR specific UUID. Your friend needs to run the script with their own UUID.

## How the algorithm works

The buddy system uses deterministic randomness:

1. `Bun.hash(accountUuid + SALT)` → 32-bit seed
2. Seed → Mulberry32 PRNG
3. Sequential rolls: rarity(weighted) → species(1/18) → eye(1/6) → hat(1/8) → shiny(1%) → 5 stats

ID priority: `oauthAccount.accountUuid` > `userID` > `"anon"`

For OAuth users (Claude Max/Pro), the server always provides `accountUuid`, so changing `userID` locally has no effect. That's why we patch the SALT instead.

## Version

Based on **Claude Code 2.1.89**. Future versions may change the SALT or algorithm.
